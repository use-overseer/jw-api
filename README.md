# JW API

**JW API** is a robust and comprehensive interface for accessing data related to JW.org services. It provides a unified way to retrieve information about publications, media, languages, and daily texts, serving as a bridge to various underlying data sources.

## Overview

This application acts as a central API gateway that simplifies interaction with:
-   **Mediator**: Access detailed categorization, media items, and translation data.
-   **WOL (Watchtower Online Library)**: Retrieve daily texts and year texts programmatically.
-   **Publication Media**: Fetch metadata and links for various publications.
-   **Bible Data**: Access Bible books and verse data.

In addition to standard REST endpoints, this project includes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server, enabling AI agents to directly query JW-related data (like Bible verses and transcripts) for enhanced context.

## Key Features

-   **RESTful API**: Clean and structured endpoints for querying data.
-   **Multi-Language Support**: robust handling of language codes and translations.
-   **Media Integration**: Easy access to media items and publication details.
-   **AI Ready**: Built-in MCP server for integrating with AI assistants.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built on Nuxt 4, ensuring high performance and type safety.

## Getting Started (For Users)

### Example Endpoints

Assuming the API is running at `http://localhost:3000`:
